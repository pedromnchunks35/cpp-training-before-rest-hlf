# Info
- Prototype for creating a REST API using CPP beast from boost library
- In order to start constructing we must download the beast librarie
- After we download it there is a .sh file in it that we must run
- After running it it says for for ./p2
- It will install all boost dependencies
- In the end we can assign it in the CMakeLists 
- We should change the current path and create a standard path where we can place our C++ libraries
# Notes
- Our vscode detects the code using `.vscode` config
- In the `c_cpp_properties.json` we must put in the include settings the path to our headers in order for it to detect it
- In the google test it was detecting it because the folder was on our workspace so it could use it there
- Thats why i putted `/home/pedromn35/cpp-libraries/boost_1_85_0/*` in our include so it could detect it without problems
- Intellisense uses this headers files which are interfaces to know which methods it can invoke to make the autocomplete
# Notes about the video
- IO Operations are costly
- We should try to write the headers and the payload in one go
- There are const buffers and mutable buffers
- Asynchronous I/O waits for a response
  - Takes a buffer and a handler 
  - Handler is what will handle the call
- We control the threads on this model
  - We can make single thread
  - Multi thread with single io_context
  - Multi thread with a io_context per thread
- `Chat Server`
  - Divided into 5 sections
    - main (creates and runs the server)
    - shared_state class (where is the server data)
      - Saves the state of sessions and docs
      - To manage clients we check the connections here
    - listener (accepts incoming connections)
      - has a "on_accept"
        - It sums the connection to the shared state and keep the connection alive 
    - http_session (handles HTTP requests on a connection)
    - websocket_session (maintains an active websocket session)
